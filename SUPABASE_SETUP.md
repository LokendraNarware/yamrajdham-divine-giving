## Database Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the Donations Table

You need to run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard to create the donations table.

2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/001_create_donations_table.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

### 2. Verify the Setup

After running the migration, you should have:
- A `donations` table with all necessary columns
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Proper indexes for performance
- Policies allowing public read/insert/update access

### 3. Test the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
