# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Resolved ✅

The `react-router-dom` module not found error has been **successfully resolved** by clearing build caches and dependencies.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Cleared Next.js build cache** (`.next` directory)
2. **Cleared TypeScript build info** (`tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`)
3. **Reinstalled dependencies** to ensure clean state
4. **Verified local build works** - Build completed successfully with no errors

## Root Cause

The error was caused by **cached build files** that contained references to `react-router-dom` even though:
- The project uses Next.js routing (not React Router)
- No `react-router-dom` imports exist in the codebase
- `react-router-dom` is not listed in `package.json` dependencies

## Vercel Deployment Steps

### 1. Clear Vercel Build Cache

In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Functions" tab
3. Click "Clear Build Cache"
4. Redeploy your project

### 2. Alternative: Force Clean Deploy

If clearing cache doesn't work:
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to "Deployments"
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy" with "Use existing Build Cache" **UNCHECKED**

### 3. Environment Variables Check

Ensure these environment variables are set in Vercel:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Cashfree API Credentials
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_cashfree_app_id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_cashfree_secret_key
CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production
CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 4. Build Settings Verification

In Vercel project settings:
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: `pnpm run build` (or leave empty for auto-detection)
- **Output Directory**: Leave empty (Next.js auto-detects)
- **Install Command**: `pnpm install`

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Always clear build cache** when switching branches or after major changes
2. **Use consistent package manager** (pnpm in this case)
3. **Avoid mixing routing libraries** (stick to Next.js routing only)

## Verification

After redeployment, verify:
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ All pages load correctly
- ✅ Donation flow works
- ✅ Admin dashboard accessible
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly

## Local Build Status

```bash
✓ Compiled successfully in 15.4s
✓ Generating static pages (35/35)
✓ Build completed successfully
```

The project is now ready for deployment to Vercel!
